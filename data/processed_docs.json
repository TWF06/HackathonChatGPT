Industry Context (2–3 sentences): Malaysia is pushing hard on digitalisation under the MyDIGITAL blueprint, with the digital economy already contributing over 22% to GDP and expected to grow further. Key sectors include services, SMEs, agriculture, tourism, finance, healthcare, and public services, but many smaller organisations still rely on manual processes, WhatsApp, and spreadsheets. 3. Problem Statement (Malaysia-Focused): Many Malaysian SMEs, education institutions, clinics, tourism operators, and local authorities want to modernise but don’t have the budget or talent to build complex software or AI systems. They struggle with things like handling FAQs, managing bookings, explaining government or financial procedures, supporting multilingual customers (BM, English, + others), and finding information buried in PDFs, forms, and policies. Students can help by building simple, AI-powered tools that solve one concrete problem for a Malaysian organisation or community, using JamAI Base as the backend. 4. Your Challenge (What participants should build): Use Generative AI + JamAI Base to build a small but realistic prototype for a Malaysian use case of your choice. For example (participants can choose others): o SME assistant – answer product/price FAQs, draft marketing posts, or help manage orders/invoices o Tourism or campus guide – answer questions about a town, university, or event in BM & English o Service/helpdesk bot – for a tuition centre, clinic, hostel, or local council (e.g., “How to pay this bill?”, “What documents do I need?”) o Document assistant – summarise and answer questions over policies, contracts, or SOPs for a business The prototype should: o Use JamAI Base tables (e.g., Action, Knowledge, Chat, Generative) to handle RAG/logic o Provide a simple interface (web/mobile/chat UI) that a real Malaysian user could understand 5. AI Opportunity (How AI & JamAI Base fit in): o Use LLMs to generate replies, summaries, plans, or messages in BM and English o Use Knowledge tables to store and embed local documents (FAQs, SOPs, PDFs, websites) and do retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) o Use Action/Generative tables to chain steps like: understand request → fetch or retrieve data → draft answer → refine o Optionally log user queries and model responses in JamAI Base to improve prompts or evaluate quality 6. Optional Resources: o JamAI Base Cloud / Self-hosted (spreadsheet-like UI + REST API, built-in LLM, vector embeddings, rerankers) o JamAI Base SDKs (jamaibase on PyPI / npm) for easy integration o",

Judging Criteria: o Local Impact & Problem Fit (25%) ▪ Is the problem clearly tied to a Malaysian context (SME, campus, local authority, tourism, etc.)? ▪ Would this actually help a real user here? o Use of JamAI Base & AI (25%) ▪ Does the project meaningfully use JamAI Base tables and orchestration, not just a single API call? ▪ Is generative AI used thoughtfully (RAG, prompt design, multi-step logic, multilingual support)? o Creativity & Relevance (20%) ▪ Is the idea fresh or a smart adaptation for the Malaysian context? o User Experience (15%) ▪ Is the interface simple and understandable for non-technical Malaysian users? o Technical Execution (15%) ▪ Does the demo work end-to-end using JamAI Base, even if the UI is simple?",
